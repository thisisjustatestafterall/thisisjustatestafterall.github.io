  <p>I think the biggest thing for me is building things with intention. So often I see people operating from a place of pretention, and it's impossible to say that I, too, do not operate similarly in some ways. However, I think it's important to be able to operate when one is doing so and try to course correct. As such, I do my best to support my local community in ways that I think are impactful and help others succeed which only helps stimulate my own success. In alignment with that, I've recently helped a friend's cousin build a website for his locksmith business, helped a local restaurant build their website and redesign their menu, and helped someone that they referred me to build a website for their automotive logistics company. I'm working on other things too, some with friends, some with family, some with strangers. I have a lot of things in mind, some bigger than others (honestly it feels like I'm talking in riddles and again that's where it feels pretentious lol) but I guess in due time all of these things will come together and tell a story maybe idk I guess we'll see.
  
  Truly nothing means anything if you just say it and never do it so why bother saying what can be done? Can it be done? Then I'll do it.</p>
